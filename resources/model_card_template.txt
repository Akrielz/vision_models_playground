# **Vision Models Playground**
This is a trained model from the Vision Models Playground repository.
Link to the repository: https://github.com/Akrielz/vision_models_playground

## **Model**
This model is a custom implementation of **<model_config['class_name']>** from the ```<model_config['module_name']>``` module.
Please look in the config file for more information about the model architecture.

## **Usage**
To load the torch model, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import torch
from vision_models_playground.utility.hub import load_vmp_model_from_hub


model = load_vmp_model_from_hub("<repo_id>")

x = torch.randn(...)
y = model(x)  # y will be of type torch.Tensor
```

To load the pipeline that includes the model, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from vision_models_playground.utility.hub import load_vmp_pipeline_from_hub

pipeline = load_vmp_pipeline_from_hub("<repo_id>")

x = raw_data  # raw_data will be of type pipeline.input_type
y = pipeline(x)  # y will be of type pipeline.output_type
```

## **Additional Information**
The train and evaluation runs are also saved using tensorboard. You can use the following command to visualize the runs:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./model
```

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./eval
```
